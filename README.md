# Install

The app is [available on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/open-gpx-tracker/id984503772) since May 2015. This version uses Apple Maps as tile server. 

Another option to install the app is to download the source code and compile it by yourself using Xcode. If you want to run it on a device, you also need an Apple developer account.

# Download Source code
This application is written in Swift. To download the code run this command in a console:

``` 
 git clone https://github.com/merlos/iOS-Open-GPX-Tracker.git
```

Then, to test it open the file `OpenGpxTracker.xcworkspace` with XCode.


The list of available tile servers is defined in `GPXTileServer.swift`. Possible values:

```swift
.Apple
.OpenStreetMap
.MapQuest
.OpenCycleMap
.CartoDB

```

Please note the [limitations of using Open Street Maps Tile Servers](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_usage_policy)

### Adding another tile server
Adding a tile server is easy, just edit the file `GPXTileServer.swift`, uncomment the lines with `AnotherMap` and modify the templateUrl to point to the new tile server.

You have a list of tile servers in [Open Street Map Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_servers)

# TODO

- Do not request user location while not tracking and in background (to save battery)
- Add user interface to change the tile server. Also include attributions and copyrights of each tile server.
